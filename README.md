# erb-second-renderer-window-example

An example of using a second window and renderer process with [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate)

Provides a basic example of creating a second renderer window for an Electron React Boilerplate based app.
The [commit history](https://github.com/jp887/electron-react-boilerplate/commits/next) describes the steps taken to add the second window and configure webpack etc.

Many of the details are also described in [this issue](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/1095).

Note: For this simple example tests etc have not been refactored to work with the with the new directory structure but this should be trivial.
